## Teaching Assistant  
**Carleton University**  
*Sep 2019 – Jul 2023*

I worked as a Teaching Assistant while completing my degree, supporting students in statistics and data focused courses that many found challenging on their first encounter.

My role went far beyond grading. I led tutorials and lab sessions where the goal was not to repeat lecture material, but to help students build intuition for concepts that often felt abstract. When something did not click, I learned to explain it from a different angle, using examples that connected theory to practical outcomes.

I spent a lot of time working one on one with students, helping them debug assignments, prepare for exams, and develop confidence in their problem solving skills. This required patience, clarity, and the ability to identify where misunderstandings actually began.

Working alongside professors also gave me exposure to course design and curriculum decisions. I helped ensure materials were clear, consistent, and aligned with learning objectives.

This experience fundamentally shaped how I communicate technical ideas. It taught me how to simplify without dumbing things down, a skill I rely on heavily when working with both technical and non technical stakeholders today.
