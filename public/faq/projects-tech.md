## Projects and Technology

**What technologies are used in this portfolio?**  
This site is built with modern web technologies including Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and animation libraries like Framer Motion. Performance, accessibility, and responsiveness are first-class concerns.

**Are your projects production ready?**  
Yes. I treat every project as if it could be used by real users. That means proper architecture, error handling, performance considerations, and clean code.

**How do you choose what to build?**  
Most projects start with a problem I personally want solved or a concept I want to understand deeply. If it feels interesting and slightly uncomfortable, it’s probably worth building.

**Which project best represents your skills?**  
Each project highlights something different. Some focus on data systems, others on AI orchestration, visualization, or security. Together they represent how I think and how I build.

**How do you approach performance and optimization?**  
I think about performance early. I pay attention to latency, data flow, caching, and unnecessary complexity. I prefer simple solutions that scale well and are easy to reason about.

**Do you use AI in your projects?**  
Yes. I use AI thoughtfully where it adds real value, whether that’s analysis, orchestration, or experimentation. I focus on understanding model behavior rather than treating AI as a black box.

**Are your projects open source?**  
Many of them are. I enjoy building in public and sharing how things work so others can learn from them.
