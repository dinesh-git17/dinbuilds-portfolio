## Using This Portfolio

**What is DinBuilds OS?**  
DinBuilds OS is a playful way of presenting my portfolio. It treats the site like an operating system where you can explore projects, experience sections, and tools naturally instead of scrolling a traditional page.

**Why does this portfolio feel like an operating system?**  
I wanted the experience to reflect how I think. Structured, exploratory, and interactive. It’s designed to reward curiosity.

**Is there a terminal I can use?**  
Yes. There’s an interactive terminal with commands you can explore. It’s both a fun feature and a small demonstration of how I think about interfaces.

**Are there easter eggs?**  
There are a few. Exploring the site fully is encouraged.

**Does this site track users?**  
No invasive tracking. I care about privacy and keep analytics lightweight and respectful.

**Is this portfolio mobile friendly?**  
Yes. The experience is designed to work smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.

**How often is this portfolio updated?**  
Frequently. This site evolves as I build new projects, refine ideas, and improve how things are presented.

**What should I check out first?**  
Start with the projects folder or open the terminal. Both give a good sense of how I build and think.
