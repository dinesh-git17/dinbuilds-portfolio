## About Dinesh

**Who is Dinesh Dawonauth?**  
I’m a data engineer and software builder based in Toronto, Canada. I specialize in building scalable systems, performance-sensitive applications, and thoughtful developer experiences. I enjoy turning complex problems into software that feels obvious to use.

**What does Dinesh specialize in?**  
My core strengths are data engineering, backend systems, and full-stack development. I work heavily with data pipelines, APIs, system design, performance optimization, and modern web technologies.

**What kind of engineer is this portfolio for?**  
This portfolio is for teams that value clean architecture, strong fundamentals, and engineers who care about both how systems work and how they feel to use.

**What industries have you worked in?**  
I’ve worked across fintech, insurance, enterprise systems, and data-heavy platforms. I’ve also built independent products and tools outside of work that explore AI, security, and visualization.

**What motivates you to build side projects?**  
Side projects are where I explore ideas that don’t fit neatly into day jobs. They let me experiment, learn deeply, and ship things end to end. Many of them start as curiosity and accidentally turn into real products.

**Are these projects real or just demos?**  
They are real. Every project here is designed, built, and maintained with production-level thinking, even when it started as an experiment.

**Are you open to work opportunities?**  
Yes. I’m open to full-time roles, contract work, and collaborations where I can contribute meaningfully and grow.
